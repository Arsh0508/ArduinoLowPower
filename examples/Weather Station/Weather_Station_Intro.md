This folder contains an example of a weather station.

It contains two separate codes one weather station with 
sleep mode and the other one without sleep mode.

These examples can help you better understand how 
exactly can we use the LowPower library to implement 
sleep mode as these would give an idea how the code would 
work both with and without the LowPower library.
